Now how we can work for create update and delete article post for build modern blog with [gatsby js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) ??

for first you can open source code project folder or cuteblog then you can run `code .` to open this source code project using visual code, then you can open content/blog folder, and you see all article is in here, so for build new post just create new md files, and write your article, for edit click on md file and change with you needed, for delete just delete post article.

simple solution you can copy article.md file then name it with you url link post, and edit article content.
