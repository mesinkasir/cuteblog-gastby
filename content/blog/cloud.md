If you need to push and deploy on cloud hosting so you can run `gatsby build` for production then you can upload public folder on host like firebase surge or other.

Or you can simply just push sourcecode project on github repo then you need to connected cuteblog repo with gatsby cloud, [vercel](https://vercel.com),heroku etc. just create new project or site name it with your site and deploy it.
